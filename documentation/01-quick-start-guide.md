## What You're Building

This template provides a production-ready web application featuring complete user authentication, modern UI components, real-time system monitoring, LLM integration, and configuration management. The debug terminal serves as a monitoring tool specifically designed to support AI-assisted development by providing the console logs and system insights that coding assistants need for effective debugging.

The application uses Vite with React and TypeScript for the frontend, Express with Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. All components deploy seamlessly to Render with automatic SSL certificates and monitoring.

## Instant Deployment Process

### Step 1: Repository Setup

Begin by forking the repository on GitHub to your personal account. This creates your own copy that you can modify and deploy independently. Once forked, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory.

The repository includes a render.yaml file that automatically configures your entire infrastructure. This blueprint tells Render exactly how to set up your database, backend API, and frontend hosting with all necessary environment variables.

### Step 2: Render Platform Deployment

Create an account at render.com and connect it to your GitHub account. When you grant Render access to your repositories, it can automatically detect changes and redeploy your application.

Select "New Blueprint" from your Render dashboard and choose your forked repository. Render reads the render.yaml configuration and provisions three services: a PostgreSQL database, an Express API server, and static site hosting for your React frontend. The entire process typically completes within five minutes.

During deployment, Render automatically generates secure environment variables including a cryptographically strong JWT secret and database connection strings. No manual configuration is required for basic functionality.

### Step 3: Deployment Verification

Once deployment completes, you'll receive URLs for both your API and frontend services. Visit the frontend URL to confirm the application loads properly. You should see a registration form and login interface.

Test the complete authentication flow by creating a new user account. This verifies that your frontend successfully communicates with the backend API and that the database connection is functioning correctly.

## Understanding Your MVP Features

### Authentication and Security Architecture

The authentication system implements JWT tokens with role-based access control. Users can register with email and password, receive secure tokens upon login, and access features based on their assigned roles. The system supports three permission levels: standard users, administrators, and super-administrators.

Session management includes automatic token refresh to maintain user sessions without requiring frequent re-authentication. All API endpoints validate tokens before processing requests, ensuring that protected resources remain secure.

### User Interface Foundation

The frontend uses shadcn/ui components built on Tailwind CSS, providing a professional appearance with consistent styling. The component library includes forms, buttons, cards, and navigation elements that automatically adapt to light and dark themes.

The interface responds fluidly to different screen sizes, ensuring functionality across desktop and mobile devices. Form validation provides immediate feedback, and loading states keep users informed during asynchronous operations.

### Debug Terminal for Development

The debug terminal appears in the admin section and monitors all system activities in real-time. This tool specifically supports AI-assisted development by capturing the detailed logs that coding assistants need to understand system behavior and suggest improvements.

When developing with AI tools, the debug terminal provides visibility into API response times, database query performance, authentication events, and error conditions. This information enables more effective collaboration with AI coding assistants during development and troubleshooting.

### LLM Integration Capabilities

The application includes built-in integration with Claude AI, allowing users to interact with language models directly through the interface. Conversations are saved to the database with full history, and the system tracks token usage for cost monitoring.

Configuration options let you adjust model parameters like temperature and maximum tokens. The system logs all LLM interactions through the debug terminal, providing transparency into AI usage patterns and costs.

### Configuration Management System

User preferences persist in the database and can be exported as portable text strings. This dual-persistence approach allows users to back up their settings and share configurations with team members.

Settings include theme preferences, language selection, LLM model parameters, and debug terminal visibility. Changes take effect immediately and synchronize across browser sessions.

## Local Development Environment

### Prerequisites and Setup

Ensure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed along with npm version 10 or higher. You'll also need Git for version control and either PostgreSQL installed locally or Docker for running a database container.

Create your local environment file by copying the included template and adding your specific values. The template includes all necessary variables with example formats, but you'll need to provide actual database credentials and API keys.

### Database Configuration

The application requires a PostgreSQL database for local development. If you have PostgreSQL installed locally, create a new database and update your environment file with the connection string. Alternatively, use the included Docker Compose configuration to run PostgreSQL in a container.

Run the Prisma migration commands to set up your database schema and seed initial data. This creates the necessary tables and inserts sample users including an administrator account for testing.

### Development Server Startup

Start the backend server first, which will begin listening on port 3000 by default. The server includes hot reloading, so changes to your code will automatically restart the application.

In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server. Vite will serve your React application on port 5173 with fast refresh enabled. The frontend automatically proxies API requests to your backend server.

Verify your local setup by visiting the frontend URL and logging in with the seeded administrator credentials. Check the debug terminal to confirm that system monitoring is functioning correctly.

## Making Your First Customizations

### Application Branding

Personalize your application by updating the configuration file with your preferred name, description, and author information. These values appear throughout the interface including the page title, navigation header, and about sections.

Modify the theme colors by adjusting the CSS custom properties in your stylesheet. The design system uses semantic color names that automatically adapt to light and dark modes.

### Adding Custom Features

Create new API endpoints by adding route files to the backend routes directory. Follow the established pattern of importing authentication middleware and using consistent error handling. The authentication system automatically provides user context for protected routes.

Build corresponding frontend components using the existing UI library patterns. Import components from the ui directory and apply consistent styling with Tailwind classes. The debug terminal will automatically log your new API calls for monitoring.

### Deployment of Changes

Commit your modifications using descriptive commit messages that follow conventional commit format. Push changes to your main branch, which triggers automatic redeployment through your CI/CD pipeline.

Monitor the deployment process through your hosting platform dashboard. The debug terminal will show increased activity during deployment as the system restarts and initializes with your changes.

## Next Steps for Development

### Deepening Feature Understanding

The Complete User Manual provides comprehensive documentation of every feature including detailed architecture explanations, customization guides, and integration patterns. This resource helps you understand how components interact and how to modify them safely.

### Establishing Professional Workflow

The Development Workflow guide covers Git strategies, continuous integration setup, and team collaboration practices. These standards ensure code quality and enable effective teamwork as your project grows.

### Preparing for Production

The Production Deployment guide explains security hardening, performance optimization, and monitoring setup. This documentation provides the foundation for scaling your MVP into a production-ready application.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Deployment Problems

If your Render deployment fails, check the service logs in your dashboard for specific error messages. Common issues include missing environment variables or build failures due to dependency conflicts.

Database connection errors typically indicate incorrect connection strings or database services that haven't finished initializing. Wait for all services to show "healthy" status before testing functionality.

### Local Development Issues

When the local development environment fails to start, verify that all prerequisites are installed and that your environment file contains valid values. Database connection failures often result from incorrect credentials or services that aren't running.

API authentication errors usually indicate mismatched JWT secrets between frontend and backend configurations. Ensure both environments use the same secret value.

### Debug Terminal Access

If the debug terminal doesn't appear, confirm that you're logged in with an administrator account and that the debug feature is enabled in your configuration. The terminal requires WebSocket connections, which some network configurations may block.

## Success Validation

After completing this guide, you should have a fully functional web application accessible via public URL, a working local development environment, basic understanding of all MVP features, and one custom feature successfully implemented and deployed.

This foundation provides everything needed for rapid application development while maintaining professional standards for security, performance, and maintainability. The debug terminal integration makes this template particularly valuable for AI-assisted development workflows.
