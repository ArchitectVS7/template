### Current Limitations
⚠️ **Missing Frontend Interfaces**
- Debug terminal UI (backend complete, no frontend)
- Configuration management UI (no backend routes or frontend)
- Analytics dashboard (no backend service or frontend)

⚠️ **Incomplete Testing**
- Basic tests exist but not comprehensive coverage
- End-to-end testing suite not implemented
- Performance testing not completed

⚠️ **Documentation Gaps**
- API documentation incomplete
- User manual accuracy not verified against implementation
- Deployment process not fully tested

---

**Current State**: Solid foundation with core functionality working, but missing key user interfaces for documented features. The application is functional for LLM chat and basic authentication, but critical features like debug terminal and configuration management are not accessible to users despite having backend support.

**Next Priority**: Complete the missing frontend interfaces to achieve 100% compliance with design documentation.

*This represents approximately 75% completion of the documented MVP specifications.*
