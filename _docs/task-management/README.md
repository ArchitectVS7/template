# Task Management Structure

This folder contains all task management and progress tracking files for the AI Development MVP project.

## Active Task Files

- **CURRENT-tasks.md** - Current priority tasks that must be completed for 100% design document compliance
- **NEXT-tasks.md** - Future enhancements and nice-to-have features (not required for compliance)
- **COMPLETED-tasks.md** - Tracking of successfully implemented features and validation status

## Subfolders

- **reports/** - Compliance reports, audit reports, and analysis documents
- **archive/** - Historical task lists and detailed analysis documents

## Task Management Workflow

1. **CURRENT-tasks.md** contains the immediate priorities for achieving compliance
2. **COMPLETED-tasks.md** tracks what has been successfully implemented
3. **NEXT-tasks.md** contains future enhancements beyond MVP scope
4. Reports are organized in the **reports/** subfolder
5. Historical and detailed analysis documents are in **archive/**

This organization ensures clear separation between active work, completed work, future work, and supporting documentation.
