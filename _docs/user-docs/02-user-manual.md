## System Architecture Overview

The application follows a three-tier architecture with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data persistence layers. The frontend React application communicates with the Express backend through a REST API, while the backend manages database operations through Prisma's object-relational mapping.

Data flows unidirectionally from user interactions through the frontend state management system to API calls, backend processing, and database operations. Real-time features use WebSocket connections to push updates back to connected clients, particularly for the debug terminal monitoring system.

The authentication layer secures all communications using JWT tokens that contain user identity and permission information. These tokens authenticate every API request and determine access to protected resources based on user roles.

## Authentication System Implementation

### Token-Based Security Model

The authentication system centers on JSON Web Tokens that encode user identity and permissions in a cryptographically signed format. When users log in successfully, the system generates both access and refresh tokens with different expiration periods to balance security and user experience.

Access tokens remain valid for one hour and accompany every API request to verify user identity and permissions. Refresh tokens last seven days and enable automatic renewal of access tokens without requiring users to log in repeatedly.

The system validates every token using a secret key that only the server knows. This approach ensures that clients cannot forge valid tokens and that expired tokens are automatically rejected.

### Role-Based Access Control

Three permission levels control access to different application features. Standard users can access the main application functionality including personal dashboards, LLM chat features, and their own configuration settings.

Administrators gain additional access to the debug terminal and system monitoring features. This elevated access supports development and troubleshooting activities while maintaining security boundaries for sensitive operations.

Super-administrators possess all administrative privileges plus system configuration capabilities and advanced security monitoring access. This highest level supports system maintenance and security oversight.

### Session Management and Security

The system tracks all active sessions in the database, recording creation time, user agent information, and IP addresses for security monitoring. When users log out or when security events require it, the system can invalidate specific sessions or all sessions for a user.

Token refresh happens automatically in the background, maintaining user sessions without interruption while ensuring that compromised tokens cannot remain valid indefinitely. Failed authentication attempts are logged and can trigger account protection measures.

Password security uses bcrypt hashing with appropriate salt rounds to protect stored credentials. The system enforces basic password complexity requirements and can be extended to support additional security measures like multi-factor authentication.

## User Interface Component System

### Design Foundation and Theming

The interface builds upon shadcn/ui components that provide accessible, well-tested React elements with consistent styling. These components use Tailwind CSS for styling, enabling rapid customization while maintaining design consistency.

The theming system uses CSS custom properties that can be dynamically updated to switch between light and dark modes. Theme colors follow semantic naming conventions, so changing the primary color automatically updates buttons, links, and accent elements throughout the application.

Component composition follows atomic design principles, with basic elements combining into more complex interface patterns. This approach ensures consistency while enabling flexibility for custom features.

### Responsive Design Patterns

The interface adapts fluidly to different screen sizes using responsive design principles. Navigation transforms from a horizontal layout on desktop to a mobile-friendly hamburger menu on smaller screens.

Content areas reflow to maintain readability across devices, with sidebar elements stacking vertically on mobile and grid layouts adjusting column counts based on available space. Form elements scale appropriately and maintain accessibility standards across all screen sizes.

Touch targets meet mobile usability standards with appropriate sizing and spacing, while hover states provide feedback on devices that support them.

### Form Handling and Validation

Forms provide immediate feedback using client-side validation with server-side verification for security. Validation messages appear inline with form fields, clearly indicating specific requirements and error conditions.

The system handles asynchronous operations gracefully with loading states that inform users about ongoing processes. Form submission includes protection against duplicate submissions and clear success or error messaging.

File uploads, where implemented, include progress indicators and appropriate file type validation to ensure security and user experience quality.

## Debug Terminal: AI Development Assistant

### Purpose and Development Integration

The debug terminal serves as a real-time monitoring interface specifically designed to support AI-assisted development workflows. When working with AI coding assistants, developers need visibility into system behavior, performance metrics, and error conditions to provide context for effective assistance.

This tool captures comprehensive logs from all system layers including user actions, API calls, database operations, and external service interactions. The information flows through a structured logging system that categorizes events by type and severity level.

Real-time updates appear through WebSocket connections, allowing developers to observe system behavior as it happens. This immediate feedback proves particularly valuable when testing new features or diagnosing issues with AI assistance.

### Monitoring and Analysis Features

The terminal displays system health indicators using a traffic light metaphor where green indicates normal operation, yellow suggests potential issues, and red signals critical problems requiring attention. These indicators aggregate multiple system metrics to provide at-a-glance status understanding.

Event filtering capabilities allow developers to focus on specific types of activity such as authentication events, API performance, or LLM usage patterns. Advanced filtering supports combining multiple criteria to isolate specific scenarios or user behaviors.

Log entries include detailed metadata such as timestamps, user contexts, request identifiers, and performance measurements. This information enables thorough analysis of system behavior and supports effective troubleshooting.

### Integration with AI Coding Workflows

When collaborating with AI coding assistants, developers can share specific log entries or filtered views to provide context about system behavior. The structured format makes it easy for AI tools to understand system state and suggest appropriate solutions.

Performance monitoring helps identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. When AI assistants suggest code changes, the debug terminal provides immediate feedback about their impact on system performance.

Error tracking and analysis support rapid iteration during development. AI assistants can analyze error patterns and suggest fixes based on the comprehensive logging information available through the terminal.

## Configuration Management Framework

### User Preference Architecture

The configuration system maintains user preferences in the database while providing export and import capabilities for portability and backup. This dual approach ensures preferences persist across sessions while enabling users to share configurations or migrate settings between environments.

Preferences include interface themes, language selections, LLM model parameters, debug terminal settings, and notification preferences. Changes take effect immediately through reactive updates that synchronize across all active user sessions.

The system validates all configuration changes to ensure they fall within acceptable ranges and don't compromise security or functionality. Invalid settings trigger appropriate error messages with guidance for correction.

### Export and Import Functionality

Configuration export generates a base64-encoded string containing user preferences along with metadata such as version information and integrity checksums. This format provides portability while maintaining data integrity during transfer and storage.

Import processes validate the configuration format, verify integrity checksums, and check version compatibility before applying settings. This validation prevents corruption and ensures that configurations remain functional across different application versions.

The system supports partial imports where users can selectively apply specific categories of settings rather than replacing their entire configuration. This flexibility supports scenarios like sharing theme preferences without affecting other settings.

### Team Configuration Templates

Advanced users can create configuration templates that capture specific setups for sharing with team members. These templates can be marked as public for broader sharing or kept private for personal use.

Template application preserves existing user settings that aren't included in the template, enabling gradual adoption of team standards without losing individual customizations.

Version control for templates supports tracking changes and reverting to previous configurations when needed. This capability proves valuable for maintaining consistent development environments across team members.

## LLM Integration Architecture

### API Integration and Management

The LLM integration provides direct access to Claude AI through a secure API connection that handles authentication, request formatting, and response processing. The system abstracts the complexity of API communication while providing full access to model capabilities.

Conversation management maintains complete interaction history with proper threading and context preservation. Each conversation receives a unique identifier and stores both user inputs and AI responses with timestamps and token usage information.

Cost monitoring tracks token consumption and calculates estimated costs in real-time. This transparency helps users understand the financial impact of their LLM usage and make informed decisions about model selection and conversation length.

### Model Configuration and Optimization

Users can select from available models based on their specific needs, with options for different performance and cost characteristics. Configuration options include temperature settings for creativity control, maximum token limits for response length, and system prompts for behavior customization.

The system provides guidance about model characteristics to help users make appropriate selections. Performance monitoring shows response times and token efficiency to support optimization decisions.

Advanced users can create custom system prompts that shape AI behavior for specific use cases. These prompts can be saved as templates and shared within teams to maintain consistency in AI interactions.

The system logs all LLM interactions through the debug terminal, providing transparency into AI usage patterns and enabling analysis of effective prompt strategies.

Conversation export supports sharing interesting interactions with team members or preserving valuable problem-solving sessions for future reference. The export format includes full context and metadata for comprehensive documentation.

## Database Schema and API Design

### Data Model Architecture

The database schema centers on user management with related tables for authentication sessions, user preferences, LLM conversations, and system monitoring. Foreign key relationships maintain data integrity while supporting efficient queries.

User entities connect to multiple related tables through proper relationship modeling. Sessions table supports multiple concurrent logins per user while maintaining security tracking. Preferences table uses JSON columns for flexible configuration storage.

Conversation and message tables support the LLM integration with proper threading and metadata storage. Debug log tables capture system events with appropriate indexing for performance and retention management.

### API Endpoint Structure

The REST API follows conventional patterns with resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods for different operations. Authentication endpoints handle user registration, login, logout, and token refresh with consistent response formats.

Protected endpoints require valid JWT tokens and return appropriate error codes for authentication failures. Role-based restrictions apply at the route level, ensuring that administrative features remain accessible only to authorized users.

Response formats maintain consistency across endpoints with proper error handling and informative messages. Pagination support handles large data sets efficiently, and filtering options enable precise data retrieval.

### Customization and Extension Patterns

Adding new database models follows established patterns with Prisma schema updates, migration generation, and corresponding API endpoint creation. The authentication middleware integrates seamlessly with new protected routes.

Frontend integration uses consistent patterns for API communication, error handling, and state management. The debug terminal automatically logs new API endpoints without additional configuration.

Database optimization supports indexing strategies for performance and proper relationship management for data integrity. Query optimization follows established patterns that work well with the Prisma ORM.
